## Description

This repository contains all the **data** (in `/data`) and **R scripts**
(in `/scripts`) necessary to examine how socio-economic factors and
colonial history influences paleontological research output. The outputs
of the scripts are provided in the `/output` and figures in the `/figs`
folder. Please cite the study as:

## Requirements

This code was developed in `R 4.1.1`. It is therefore recommended to use
the same or any more up-to-date version of R for reproducing the
analyses in this study.

## Setup

You will need to either use the Rstudio project environment or set your
working directory to the root of this folder.

To install all required depdendencies (packages), run:

``` r
source(file.path("inst","dependencies")
```

## Scripts

The `scripts/` folder contains all the code generated for the above
mentioned study.

-   **00-prepare_data.R:** This script prepares the data to be used in
    following analyses.

-   **01-prop_per_aff_country:** This script computes the contribution
    to fossil data per country, including domestic and foreign research.

-   **02-network parachute.R:** This script is used for global network
    analyses and to calculate the parachute index per country.

-   **03-model.R:** This script is used for the path analysis to
    represent the relationship between the socio-economic factors and
    research output.
